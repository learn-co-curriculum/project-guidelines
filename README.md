TODO:

Please advise on what is expected here or provide guidelines.
Suggestions:

Work with EITHER p5 or A-Frame in pairs/groups and choose A or B.

Option A (more fun): Plan a SIMPLE game to make and go for it!

Option B (more solidifying of important skills): Plan a SIMPLE game to make that somehow incorporates the usage of an API. (Less recommended because some students would almost surely get hung up managing asynchronous responses with the already difficult to manage constant update nature of both p5 and a-frame).
